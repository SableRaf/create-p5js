# p5.js v2.x TypeScript project

## Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

### Install and run

To install dependencies and start vite dev server

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Choose global-mode or instance-mode p5.js

Two sketches are provided in src, one for each mode.

If you're not sure, use global mode.

Delete whichever of the two you don't need,

Ensure index.html is pointing at the right one.

### (optional) Type-check all your files

VSCode will type-check the files you currently have open.

To type-check _all_ your files, run:

```bash
npm run type-check
```
